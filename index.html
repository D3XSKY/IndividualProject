                          <p> I love playing games a lot and I used to play CS:GO, Tibia, CS 1.6, etc. I don't have so much time right now. I'm preoccupied learning programming and doing boring EPA assignments.<br>
                        Fortunately, the end of academic year is closing in and I expect maybe the best summer I ever had. I forgot to mention that I spent one summer working in the USA in the Work Experience Section.<br>
                That was an awesome experience. I was a lifeguard on a swimming pool. Most of the day you sit and burn on sun while you're watching old people swim and chill. <br>
        After you finish your work, you gotta cycle back to your apartment and then eventually drink heavily with your room mates. Anyway, we did a lot of stupid stuff for the whole summer and I had the best birthday ever overthere. 
In the end, this project was interesting and I enjoyed doing it and learned really much in the process. </p>
